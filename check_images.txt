Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 

Yes they do.

2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 

No.
All three models classified a Dog_01.jpg as a "labrador retriver", but they all classified Dog_02.jpg as a "balance beam, beam".


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: 

Yes they do.

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:
Based on the results, the three models functioned exactly the same (they even all classified the object image as the same object), so we need to run more tests to make a suggestion on which model architecture does the best at classifying images. However, the VGG model used 4 seconds, but the other two models used 3 seconds. The time usage still might not be a strong factor to indicate the efficiency of the models since we have a very small image sample.
